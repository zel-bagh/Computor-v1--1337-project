# Computor-v1--1337-project

Computor-v1 is a polynomial second and lower degree equations solver.

The equation should be presented in the standard polynomial form, requiring no further simplification. It must consist of terms in the format (a)*x^(n), where (a) is a constant, x is the variable, and (n) is a non-negative integer {0, 1, 2}. Operations between terms should be limited to addition, subtraction.
